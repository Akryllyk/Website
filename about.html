      About Me

    <p id ="AboutText">
      I've always had an interest in computers since I was around 4-5 years old. As I grew older, I began to see how they can change our lives for the better so easily.
      In year 7, when I was 11, I started to learn the basics of coding through scratch, where I regularly helped people in my class who couldn't figure it out for themselves as quickly.
      Then, in year 9 I started to learn how to properly code and structure my programs. This involved learning how to use AppInventor v1 and python 3.2.
      After high school, in college, I learnt Pascal (not any of the students choice), where we did linear and object orientated programming. I also briefly brushed with haskell, functional programming in general and SQL at a level too.
      Finally, in uni i have been taught java to an intermediate level.
